Build a complete application for managing construction projects with a strong focus on daily tracking, delay detection, cost impact analysis, and intelligent recommendations. The system should be divided into three core modules:

---

üß± MODULE 1: PROJECT CREATION & RESOURCE SETUP

Allow users to create and manage multiple construction projects. For each project, provide the following functionalities:

1. Create New Project:
   - Enter project name
   - Choose location
   - Select project start date and end date
   - Set number of working days per month
   - Choose a country calendar (to exclude government holidays)

2. Add Resources to Project:
   - Human Resources:
     - Add multiple roles (e.g., Mason, Manager)
     - For each role: enter role name, number of workers required, and daily cost per worker
   - Materials:
     - Add multiple materials (e.g., Concrete, Steel)
     - For each material: enter name, total quantity required (in generic "units"), and cost per unit
   - Equipment:
     - Add multiple equipment types (e.g., Crane, Bulldozer)
     - For each equipment: enter name, number of units required, and rental cost per day

3. Miscellaneous Budget:
   - Allow the user to enter additional categories and amounts (e.g., Security, Transport)

4. Budget Calculation:
   - Automatically calculate and display the total budget:
     - Human Resource Budget
     - Material Budget
     - Equipment Budget
     - Miscellaneous Budget
   - The total budget must be displayed but not directly editable (except Miscellaneous).

5. Edit Project:
   - User can edit project metadata
   - Can add, update, or remove resources (HR, materials, equipment)
   - Cannot directly modify calculated budget fields

---

üìÖ MODULE 2: DAILY PROJECT REPORTING (DPR)

Allow the user to submit a Daily Project Report (DPR) for each project, once per day. Each report should collect:

1. Project Selection:
   - Select from list of existing projects

2. Location & Weather:
   - Enter or confirm project location
   - Automatically fetch and display real-time weather data for the location

3. Resource Usage Tracking:
   - Allow the user to **manually select** which resources were used today (from the project's defined resources)
   - For each selected resource (HR role, material, equipment):
     - Input ‚ÄúNumber Required Today‚Äù
     - Input ‚ÄúNumber Available Today‚Äù or ‚ÄúPresent Today‚Äù

4. Project Progress:
   - Enter today's percentage of project completed

5. Budget Usage:
   - Enter any extra budget used today (manual entry)
   - Provide a reason or comment for extra budget usage

6. AI Analysis (auto-generated):
   - Calculate and display:
     - Estimated delay for the day (based on shortages)
     - Estimated cost impact
     - Summary of resource gaps and deviations
     - Recommendations to avoid delay (auto-generated)
   - These insights should be saved along with the DPR

7. Save DPR:
   - Save this report with timestamp and project ID
   - Do not allow re-submission for the same project and day

---

üìä MODULE 3: PROJECT OVERVIEW & ANALYTICS

Provide a comprehensive project dashboard with visualizations and insights based on historical DPR data.

1. Overview Dashboard (Per Project):
   - Display project summary and metadata
   - Show total number of days reported
   - Show overall completion percentage
   - Show total delay in days (calculated)
   - Show total extra cost incurred
   - Show breakdown of delay reasons (e.g., material shortage, bad weather)

2. Charts & Graphs:
   - Project progress over time (line chart)
   - Budget usage vs actual usage (bar chart)
   - Delay reasons frequency (pie chart)

3. AI-Powered Recommendations:
   - Analyze all DPR data and generate:
     - Patterns of delays
     - Suggestions to improve workflow or resource planning
     - Critical risk areas and next steps

---

üí¨ MODULE 4: AI CHAT ASSISTANT (Optional but Ideal)

Integrate an AI chat assistant that:
1. Responds to natural language queries about the selected project
2. Uses DPR data, project metadata, and weather info to answer questions like:
   - ‚ÄúWhy is my project delayed?‚Äù
   - ‚ÄúWhat can I do to avoid tomorrow‚Äôs delay?‚Äù
   - ‚ÄúShow me my cost overrun due to manpower shortage‚Äù
3. Provides recommendations, explanations, and context-aware responses
4. Chat history is saved per project

---

‚úÖ GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:
- User should be able to create, view, edit, and delete projects
- Daily reports are stored per project and per date
- AI-generated insights are stored along with the data
- All user inputs should be validated before saving
- System should be responsive and user-friendly
- Charts and analytics must be visually clear and easy to interpret

Build this as a fully working system ‚Äî no placeholder logic or mock data. Every field and feature must work exactly as described above.
